/**
 * An example of C/MRI inputs and outputs
 * ======================================
 * Sets up pins 2-5 as an outputs with LEDs, and pins 6-9 as inputs with pullups.
 * 
 * 1: Set up a JMRI connection, see hello_world, steps 1-4
 * 2: Open Tools > Tables > Lights and click 'Add'
 * 3: Add a new light at hardware address 1, then click 'Create'.
 * 4: Repeat for hardware address 2, 3, 4 and close the window. Ignore the save message.
 * 5: Click on 'Sensors' and set up new sensors for hardware address 1, 2, 3 and 4.
 * 6: You'll notice the TX and RX LEDs burst into life. This is JMRI polling the state of our sensors.
 * 7: Ground pin 6, you'll see sensor #1 go Active, while the rest are Inactive.
 * 8: Switch to Lights and play around with the State buttons. Congratulations!
 * 
 * Debugging:
 * Open the CMRI > CMRI Monitor window to check what is getting sent and received.
 * With 'Show raw data' turned on the output looks like:
 *    [41 50]  Poll ua=0
 *    [41 52 01 00 00]  Receive ua=0 IB=1 0 0 
 * 
 * 0x41 = 65 = A = address 0
 * 0x50 = 80 = P = poll, i.e. PC asking C/MRI to transmit its state back to PC
 * 
 * 0x41 = 65 = A = address 0
 * 0x52 = 82 = R = receive, i.e. PC receiving state data from C/MRI 
 * 0x01 = 0b00000001 = 1st bit is high
 * 0x00 = 0b00000000 = all other bits off
